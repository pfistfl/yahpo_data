# v1.0.1

* Addressed inconsistency in the epochs argument of `lcbench`. The correct maximum is 50, not 52.
* Addressed inconsistency in ef and ef_construction args for `aknn` learner in `rbv2` scenarios.
  The correct lower and upper bounds are 8, 256 and 8, 512 respectively.
  This leads to slightly adapted search spaces for `rbv2_aknn` and `rbv2_super`.
